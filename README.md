# CSCI231-Project-8
This program creates a two-dimensional array that will convert a decimal number into a binary number, which will then determine whether a specific element (coin) is a head or tail. It begins by prompting the user to input a decimal number between 0-511. After input, the number is checked to see whether it is valid. If it is not, the program ends, else a message is outputted and then the method coinState is called. This method then begins to convert the decimal number into a binary number. It does this by first looking if the number input is greater than or equal to 2^8, and if it is, a 1 would be assigned to the first row of the first column, else a 0 is placed there. This loops until 2^0 (the final digit in the binary number) has a 0 or 1. After conversion, then the array is looped through, and if the specific element contains a 0, 'H' is outputted for heads, and if it contains 1, 'T' is outputted for tails.
